# This is my story

1. YOU - She is a doing some jogging
2. NEED - When she suddenly start thinking about life 
3. GO - And then she realized that she has nothing to eat after the excercise
4. SEARCH - She started searching for a store 
5. FIND - She realized that there is nothing open at that time at the morning
6. TAKE - Thinking on what she is going to do, she was really really hungry
8. CHANCE - Finally she decided to go into her mother's house for some food
